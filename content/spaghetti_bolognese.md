## Ingredients

* 2 or 3 cans of diced tomatoes
* 200g mixed pork/beer minced meat
* 1 large onion halved and sliced
* 1 green bell pepper cut in small pieces
* 200g mushrooms
* half a teaspoon of thyme
* half a teaspoon of oregano
* pepper and salt
* half a teaspoon of Mccormic Italian Seasoning... If you can't find this, "herbes de provence" will do just fine.
* A small bush of parsley, chopped.

## Directions

* Put some olive oil in a pan and fry the onion for about 3 to 5 minutes.
* Add the minced meat and chop it up a bit with a wooden spoon. Spice it up with some salt and pepper.
* Also add the oregano, thyme and Italian Seasoning.
* Fry until the meat is nice and brown. Lower the heat if necessary.
* Put some oil in a big pot and fry the bell peppers on medium heat until for about 3 - 4 minutes. Stir often so they don't burn
* Add the mushrooms and fry until they are starting to get a little soft but not completely squishy.
* Now add the diced tomatoes to the bell peppers and bring to a boil.
* Add the onions and meat.
* Finally add the parsley and have the whole thing boil for a few more minutes.
* If you wish, you can put in some spicy peppers too.
