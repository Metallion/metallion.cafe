## Ingredients

* 1,5 KG of beef chopped in bite size pieces
* About a tea spoon of salt
* About one and a half tea spoons of pepper
* 3 table spoons of flour
* butter
* 3 big onions
* 2 bottles of dark beer. I suggest Chimay Blue.
* 1 tea spoon of dried thyme
* 3 laurel leafs
* 1,5 tea spoons of red berry jam
* 1 table spoon of red wine vinegar

## Directions

#### Fry the meat

* Put the flour, salt and pepper in a little bowl and mix them well.
* Now rub the pieces of meat through this mixture so they're all covered on flour. If the flour runs out, remake the mixture with the same proportions.
* Put some butter in a frying pan on high heat and wait until it's looking a bit brown.
* Now fry the meat so it's nice and brown on every side. It doesn't matter if it's still raw in the middle since we're going to stew it afterwards. Make sure not to put too much meat in it at the same time so it's properly fried and not cooked. Fry the meat in several batches if the pan is too small.

#### Prepare the stew

* Chop up the onions.
* Put some butter in a big pot on medium heat.
* Bake the onions in this for about 15 minutes until they're nice and brown. Raise the heat if it doesn't go fast enough.
* Now add the meat.
* Poor the beer into the frying pan that you baked the meat in and scrape of the burned bits on the bottom of the pan. (Yes, while the beer is in there)
* Poor the beer into the pot and add the laurel and thyme.
* Stew it on low heat for a few hours. The meat has to become really soft.
* 5 minutes before taking it off the fire you should add the jam and vinegar for some extra taste. Make sure you don't forget this because it adds a lot of taste!
