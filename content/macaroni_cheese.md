## Ingredients

* Leek (about 2 of them)
* Mushrooms (about 250g)
* 1 onion
* Ham
* Pasta
* Olive oil
* Butter (about 50g)
* Flour (5 spoons)
* Grated cheese (1 package)
* Milk
* Pepper, salt and nutmeg
* Bread powder


## Directions

#### Vegetables

* Cut the leek in small pieces, wash and stew on a medium fire. Add pepper and salt to it.
* Brush off the black soil from the mushrooms. Don't wash them in water though.
* Cut the onion in little pieces and fry it in a pot with some oil until the pieces are a bit golden brown <^_/^>
* Add the mushrooms to the onions and stew a bit more. Add pepper and salt to them too.
* The mushrooms create a lot of water. Boil heavily to vaporise it.

#### Sauce

* Melt the butter in a big bowl. The vegetables and pasta will go in here as well later on.
* Now turn off the fire and put all the flout into the bowl and stir it well together with the butter. You should get a bit of a yellowish powder.
* Add some milk to it and turn the fire back on. Stir it at all times because it easily sticks to the bottom.
* Stir until it gets thick and then add some more milk. Repeat this process until you have enough sauce.
* Turn down the fire and add the cheese. It will melt in the hot sauce. Also add a lot of nutmeg in this stage.
* Now finally add the vegetables and stir it well together.

#### Crust

* Put the pasta and the sauce together in an oven dish. Now cover the top in bread powder.
* Put some small bits of butter in a few places and put the thing under the grill.

All done now. ^_^
