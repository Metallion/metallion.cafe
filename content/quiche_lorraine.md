## Ingredients

#### Crust

* 1 egg
* About 75 cl of milk
* Flour
* 1 tablespoon of molten butter

#### Filling

* 150g chopped up bacon
* 4 eggs
* 250g gratted cheese
* 250 dl cream
* About 25 cl milk
* Pepper
* Nutmeg

## Directions

#### Crust

* Put a bit of flour in a bowl
* Add the egg, butter and a bit of milk
* Mix it all together. I always use a single chopstick for this ^_^
* Keep gradually adding flour until you get a knedible dough
* now kned it for a while and then use the doughroller to spread it out on the table
* Grease a pie dish and put the dough inside it
* Preheat the oven at 180 degrees C and put the dish inside for 10 minutes.

#### Filling

* When the crust is done, take it out of the oven put in the bacon and cheese in several layers
* Break the four eggs into a bowl and scramble them with a fork.
* Add the cream and some milk until it looks like you have enough filling.
* Spice it up with a fair amount of pepper and nutmeg. Don't put in any salt since the bacon is already very salty.
* Mix the whole thing so you've got a homegeneous substance
* Finally poor it over the bacon and cheese in the filling.
* If you want to you can poor another layer of cheese over it.
* Now finally bake it in the oven at 180 degrees C for between 40 and 60 minutes depending on your oven.
