## Ingredients

* olive oil
* 2 cloves of garlic, crushed
* 1 large onion, sliced
* 1 small eggplant, cut up into small pieces
* 2 green bell peppers, chopped
* 2 cans of diced tomatoes
* 3 to 4 small zucchini, sliced
* 1 teaspoon basil
* 1/2 teaspoon oregano
* 1/4 teaspoon thyme
* 2 tablespoons parsley

## Directions

* Get yourself a big pot, grease it with some olive oil and put it on medium heat.
* Fry the onions in here for about seven minutes while spicing them up with the garlic. They should be nice and soft afterwards. Make sure to stir often so they don't burn.
* Now add the eggplant and stir until they're mostly oiled up.
* Put in the bell peppers immediately afterwards.
* Now put a lit on it and cook the vegetable mixture for ten more minutes. Open it up to sir every now and then.
* Finally add the zucchini, tomatoes and all the spices. Mix it up well and then cook it 15 minutes more on lower heat.
* Before serving, taste the eggplant to make sure that it's nice and tender. If this is the case, all the other ingredients should be fine too.
* If you want to, you can make it look a little nicer by cutting up a bit more fresh parsley and sprinkling that over when it's done.
