## Igredients

#### Crust

* 250g flour
* 80g light brown sugar
* 160g butter
* a little salt (about the tip of a knife)

#### Filling

* 750g quark (cream cheese)
* 3 eggs
* 150g white sugar
* 50g flour
* 1 lemon

## Directions

#### Crust

* Put the butter in the microwave for a while so it will melt. We need it to be completely liquid.
* Put the flour, brown sugar, butter and salt together in a bowl.
* Mix it well together until you can make a ball of dough from it using your hands. Add extra flour if it's too liquid.
* Grease a fairly deep pie dish.
* Now put the ball of dough in the middle and squeeze it so it gets spread all around the place. Push it up against the edges too.
* Put this in the oven on 180 degrees Celsius for about 20 minutes.

#### Filling

* Grate the lemon peal into a bowl and squeeze out the juice afterwards.
* Split the egg whites and yolks into different bowls.
* Mix the egg whites well together until they are completely stiff.
* Add the white sugar to the yolks and stir until all the sugar has been absorbed. It needs to become a white foamy mix. It might take a while but you'll gradually see it getting more white as you stir.
* Add the 50g of flour and some cream cheese. Mix this well until the mixture has no hard pieces left.
* Now add the rest of the cream cheese little by little and stir well.
* Also gradually add the lemon peal and juice in this stage.
* When all the cream cheese and lemon is finally added, it's time to add the stiff egg whites. Use a big spoon to do this so you don't break the air bubbles inside too much.
* Finally poor this mixture into the prebaked crust and put it in the oven again for another hour. 180 degrees Celsius again. There should be a yellow-brown crust on top when it's ready.
