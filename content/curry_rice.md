## Ingredients

* Japanese rice
* Beef
* Onion
* Potatoes
* Carrots
* Japanese curry roux
* Salt
* Pepper

## Directions

* Cook the rice
* Cut the beef in bite size pieces and shake salt and pepper over it.
* Cut the onion, carrots and potatoes a little bigger than the beef.
* Grease a big pot with oil or butter.
* Fry the beef until the surface is nice and brown.
* Put in the onion and fry a bit more.
* Now it's time for the carrots and the potatoes to join the fun.
* Fry for a while more and then fill it up with water.
* Bring it to a boil and remove the foam that forms on the surface.
* When all the vegetables are well boiled, turn off the fire, break the curry roux blocks into small pieces and add them in there.
* Stir until the blocks have melted.

All done. ^_^ Now fill up half the plates with rice and the other half with curry and eat with a spoon.
