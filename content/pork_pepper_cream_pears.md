## Ingredients

#### Meat

* Thick slices of pork. About 2 or 3 per person.
* Pepper and salt
* 250 dl of cream
* Butter
* 1 table spoon of brandy

#### Pears

The thing is I've always done this by feeling. Adding the stuff little by little and tasting every now and then so I don't have an exact amount to write down.

* Pears
* Half a lemon
* Cinnamon
* A little bit of sugar
* A bottle of wine red whine

## Directions

#### Meat

* Pour salt and pepper over the raw meat and rub it in with your hands.
* Put a fair amount of butter in a frying pan and fry in high heat until it's brown.
* Now add the meat and quickly fry them on both sides  so it's nice and brown on the outside.
* Turn it down to low heat and gently fly it for about 45 minutes.
* Set it aside when done.

#### Sauce

* Poor all the cream into the pan that you just fried the meat in.
* Add the brandy.
* Spice it up thoroughly with pepper.
* Fry on medium heat until it's a little thick.

#### Pears

* Peel the pears and cut them in pieces.
* Put them in a pot with a little bit of water on the bottom. Just enough to they won't burn.
* First cook them like this for a little bit and when the water evaporates, add red wine.
* From here on gradually add the cinnamon, sugar and lemon juice until you feel the taste is alright.
* All done now. Just lay it out nicely on some plates and impress your friends. ^_^
